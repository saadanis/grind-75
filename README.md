Solving [Grind 75](https://grind75.com), primarily preferring Python.

## About
Grind 75 is the customizable and dynamic successor of [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU), a list of 75 frequently asked interview questions, curated by [Yangshun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangshun/). Although the list can be curated to exclude certain topics, change the number and order of questions, I have decided to stick with the default unmodified list. The questions have been grouped into eight weeks, with around 10 problems per week.
