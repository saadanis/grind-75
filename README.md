## About
[Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) was a list of 75 frequently asked interview problems, curated by [Yangshun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangshun/), an ex-Meta engineer. [Grind 75](https://grind75.com) is its more customizable and dynamic successor. Although it can be curated to exclude certain topics and change the number and order of problems, I have decided to stick with the default unmodified list. Problems have been grouped into eight weeks, with around 10 problems per week.
